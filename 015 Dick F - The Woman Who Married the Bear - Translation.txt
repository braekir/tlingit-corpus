1	Me.
2	This is the way
3	it was told to me,
4	the way this ancient story
5	was told to me.
6	These people,
7	are Athabaskans,
8	those living
9	in the Interior,
10	Athabaskans.
11	And
12	this story is about them.
13	This is it; I will teIl it today,
14	the tenth day
15	of the month,
16	the way it was told to me.
17	This story
18	is how it was first told.
19	These Athabaskans
20	lived really isolated.
21	Next
22	it was summer.
23	The season was changing to summer.
24	Spring
25	is what they called it; the remains of winter.
{Page = 197}
26	And this
27	Indian celery was growing.
28	This young woman
29	was engaged
30	to her father’s nephew
31	her father’s sister’s child.
32	He was going to marry her.
33	And the women went for Indian celery.
34	Wow! they collected Indian celery.
35	They were packing them on their backs.
36	What happened anyway?
37	After they walked for a long way
38	the straps broke
39	on the young woman’s pack.
40	While
41	they were still walking,
42	while they were still walking
43	they came upon
44	bear tracks; it had just gone through there.
45	Ahead of them,
46	it went ahead of them.
47	This
48	young woman
49	stepped in the leavings.
50	And her foot slipped on it.
51	So when she stood up it was all over her.
52	So then she said this to it,
53	“Why is it
54	they always crap in our way
55	the big basket butt?”
56	This was all
57	she said.
58	Everyone was sitting waiting for her again.
59	They started going again after she cleaned herself up.
60	I wonder how many of them and how they got out of there.
61	Here they broke--
62	the things she was packing with,
63	Athabaskan thongs.
64	This is what they called this rawhide:
65	Athabaskan thongs.
66	This is why there is a proverb,
{Page = 199}
67	“Even an Athabaskan thong would break.”
68	This is what we say.
69	Ei.ei.ei.ei, the straps wou1d break.
70	Toward evening
71	she was still tying the straps.
72	Gone!
73	Everyone had 1eft her.
74	Then she got up and started walking again; after she finished tying it
75	she started wa1king again.
76	When he came toward her he was just 1ike her paternal uncle,
77	her father’s sister’s child,
78	the one she was engaged to.
79	He was just 1ike him coming toward her.
80	So, he spoke to her.
81	After he spoke to her he took the bundle from her.
82	He packed the bundle
83	for her.
84	They went along for so long; they went along for so very long.
85	They walked so long it was now dark.
86	Now they came to a p1ace to overnight. “Let's just spend the night here.”
87	So they spent the night there.
88	There wasn’t anything different.
89	He was a T1ingit in her eyes,
90	a human being, a real human.
91	There wasn’t even anything different.
92	Now! With this wood
93	they built a fire.
94	They were sitting next to it; they were eating.
95	Maybe she brought
96	food for them.
97	When they were done, when they finished eating,
98	they went to bed.
99	Because there wasn’t anything different.
100	Just a human, a real human.
101	It must have been early dawn.
102	He rolled away from her.
103	He rolled away from the woman.
{Page = 201}
104	When she awoke
105	she was startled.
106	Her fingers feIt through his fur.
107	This is when
108	she felt it was a bear.
109	He rolled over to face her; he looked like a human being again.
110	That is when he told her,
111	“Don't be afraid.
112	I won't hurt you.
113	I am going to marry you though.
114	You insulted me
115	in front of those people.
116	You cussed at me.
117	But
118	I won't kill you; but you will be my wife.”
119	She still didn’t feel any different.
120	He was just like a human being in her eyes.
121	There wasn’t even anything different.
122	Now, at one point, they had come upon the others.
123	Fall.
124	Toward fall when salmon come up the streams.
125	That's when
126	they started going
127	to the land of the salmon.
128	They were drying salmon
129	just like us,
130	just like us humans.
131	To her eyes
132	they were drying salmon.
133	They were getting salmon for dryfish.
134	The women with her
135	were packing
136	the firewood.
137	They were getting drift logs right out of the water,
138	water logged.
139	But she
140	was looking only for dry wood.
141	Wow! How it would burn
142	but the fires of the others,
143	would look as if they were on1y steaming.
{Page = 203}
144	Now! at one point they were corning in
145	just like humans.
146	Well.
147	Take me for example.
148	Me,
149	I come inside,
150	when I take my coat off
151	I'll shake it.
152	This is how,
153	as they were coming in
154	they were taking off
155	their coats.
156	When they shook them they wou1d shake them over the fire.
157	Wow!
158	What did it burn like?
159	Hers though wou1d keep going out,
160	being water logged.
161	Who knows why it was like this!
162	So the other women showed her what to do
163	with the wet ones,
164	when they were coming in.
