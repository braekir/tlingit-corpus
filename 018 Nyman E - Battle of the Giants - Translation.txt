 1	They used to be situated opposite each other, they say:
 2	on this side was Lkoodaséitsʼk,
 3	and on this side, Wasʼasʼéi.
 4	Then they insulted each other.
 5	[Before that] they had gotten along well together;
 6	agreeing on everything they proposed to do.
 7	They were giants-
 8	ḵudziteeyi át, they are called.
 9	Then
10	suddenly they got into a fight.
11	These mountains used to be fine;
12	they were nice and neat.
13	But when [those giants] fought [they rolled over them],
14	so some of them are [squashed in places] like that,
15	and like that,
16	those mountains.
17	Then
18	“The Taku should belong to me,”
19	each said to the other.
20	“No, I’m already sitting here;
21	I’m not about to move off,”
22	[Lkoodaséitsʼk] said.
23	It was the one who was to be decapitated who was speaking.
24	First they would provoke each other,
25	then they would forget about it,
26	and then they would start up on it again,
27	provoking each other.
28	One day they got into a fight [over it].
29	He grabbed him; Wasʼasʼéi grabbed [Lkoodaséitsʼk], they say.
30	Then he broke his head off right here;
31	he decapitated him.
32	He threw it across [the river, saying],
{Page = 5}
33	“Let it become Lkoodaséitsʼk’s head.”
34	So that is how it is.
35	There are little trees growing here and there on it.
36	Tuen he yanked his heart out,
37	because [Lkoodaséitsʼk] had tried to wrest [the Taku] from him.
38	As for his heart, [he said,]
39	“Let Lkoodaséitsʼk’s heart become the Heart of the Taku.”
40	[The Taku] flows like this;
41	it landed here.
42	It looks like a human heart.
43	The windpipe
44	he pulled down
45	and then yanked it out.
46	It [became a small island that] extends as far as over there.
47	For some reason there are trees growing here,
48	[it is] like a human shoulder, like this.
49	Here he pulled the windpipe out,
50	here,
51	and water flows out there.
52	“Let ice water flow out into the Taku
53	for everyone,
54	for the Tlingit,” they say [he said].
55	So
56	what do you think: we don’t drink even a cup of it, it is so cold,
57	that water.
58	Now I have been asking them about it-
59	Harry Carlick says
60	he has walked across that small island
61	and inspected [the waterfall] carefully, he says.
62	It is nothing but rock;
63	it is solid rock, he says.
64	[It starts] from somewhere far below and is very thick,
65	that rock.
66	Well, it could be, you know, his [windpipe].
67	[After all,] Lkoodaséitsʼk is a [rock] cliff,
68	a mountain;
69	it is a mountain.
70	So …
{Page = 7}
71	{Wasʼasʼéi too?}
72	Wasʼasʼéi
73	was upset [by what happened],
74	He [said],
75	“I will locate across from Keishixjixʼaa.”
76	Therefore he is there.
77	“People that are truly self-confident
78	will gain sustenance from my sides,”
79	he said.
80	One time
81	we went ashore there.
82	Now my deceased husband was not [daunted by anything];
83	no matter what kind of place [he had to go to get it,
84	he would keep on until] he got what he was after.
85	He climbed up that mountainside;
86	it was [steep] like this.
87	He followed [the hillside] upward.
88	Here there is an outcropping;
89	he came up to this place,
90	like this,
91	to the outcropping.
92	When he had made his way there, he said,
93	he looked back down, and the boat was not visible.
94	“Now how am going to get back?”
95	Now where he was climbing there were seagull eggs
96	lying here and there, [seagull] nests.
97	He was gathering the seagull eggs from [the nests].
98	It looked to him like it would be too risky
99	[to go out onto] that outcropping [and] walk about on it.
100	How was he going to come back? –
101	he could make it all right [but he could see no way back].
102	So
103	he turned back there.
104	I guess he had [the sleeves of] his shirt [knotted together and inside them]
105	he had those seagull eggs slung around his neck.
106	Up high, he was way up high.
107	They used to speak to [the mountain],
108	“Don’t let anything bad happen to me, grandfather,” they
109	would say to it.
110	And
111	that mountain could understand human speech too.
